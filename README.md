<h2> Intro To Pyhton Turtle </h2>

* Python turtle is a library in Python that allows users to create simple graphical programs using a turtle that can move around the screen. The turtle can be controlled using a set of simple commands, such as forward, backward, left, and right, to move the turtle in different directions. The turtle can also change its color, shape, and size, as well as draw lines and shapes on the screen.

* The turtle library is part of the standard Python library and does not need to be installed separately. It is often used in educational settings as an introduction to programming and computer graphics.

* To use the turtle library in a Python script, you need to import it using the following statement:

**import turtle**

Once imported, you can create a turtle object and use its methods to control the turtle's movement and drawing on the screen.

* For example, to make the turtle move forward by 100 units and turn right by 90 degrees:

**import turtle**

**my_turtle = turtle.Turtle()**
**my_turtle.forward(100)**
**my_turtle.right(90)**

The turtle module also have some built-in methods that allow you to create shapes, like circles, squares and etc.

It is also worth mentioning that turtle library is mostly used by children and beginners in the world of programming and it is a good way to start learning programming and logic.
